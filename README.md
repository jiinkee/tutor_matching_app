## Submission notes
- All our application source code can be found in the Assignment folder.
- The class diagram, design rationale and demo video are in the Design_Documents folder.

## Set up
1. Clone repo
2. Import `project/Application` as an Android project
3. Create `apikey.properties` at the root directory, i.e. the root of `Application` folder
4. Add your API key into the apikey.properties in this fashion: `API_KEY={your API Key}`.
5. We found that using the Android emulator will result in SSL error, hence we highly encourage you to run the application on an **actual Android device**. 
To install and run app in your device, please refer to [this guide](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app).
